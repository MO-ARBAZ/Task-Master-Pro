## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express.js
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose ODM
- **CORS** for cross-origin requests
- **dotenv** for environment configuration

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Axios** for API calls
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Custom hooks** for state management

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your MongoDB connection string:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/taskmanagement
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/tasks` - Retrieve all tasks
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create a new task
- `PATCH /api/tasks/:id` - Update a task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete a task

## Development Approach

### Architecture Decisions
- **Clean Architecture**: Separated concerns between frontend and backend layers
- **Custom React Hooks**: Built reusable `useTasks` hook for state management
- **Component-Based Design**: Created modular, maintainable components
- **TypeScript Integration**: Implemented type safety across the application

### UI/UX Philosophy
- **Modern Glassmorphism**: Implemented trending design with backdrop blur effects
- **Intuitive Interactions**: Added inline editing to minimize user friction
- **Accessibility First**: Ensured keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Mobile-Responsive**: Designed with mobile-first approach
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Used color coding and typography for better UX
- **User Safety**: Added confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### Performance Considerations
- **React Optimization**: Used useMemo for expensive filtering operations
- **Efficient Rendering**: Implemented controlled components pattern
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error boundaries
- **Loading UX**: Created smooth loading states for better perception

## Trade-offs Considered

### Technology Choices
- **Tailwind vs Custom CSS**: Chose Tailwind for rapid development and consistency
- **State Management**: Used React hooks instead of Redux for simplicity
- **TypeScript**: Added for better developer experience and fewer runtime errors

### Feature Prioritization
- **Drag & Drop**: Skipped in favor of polished core features
- **Real-time Updates**: Focused on solid CRUD operations first
- **Advanced Filtering**: Implemented basic filtering over complex search

## What I'd Improve With More Time

### Features
- **Drag & Drop**: Task reordering and status changes
- **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket integration
- **Advanced Search**: Full-text search across tasks
- **Task Categories**: Organize tasks by projects or categories
- **Notifications**: Due date reminders and push notifications
- **Dark Mode**: Theme switching capability

### Technical Improvements
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage with Jest and React Testing Library
- **E2E Tests**: Cypress or Playwright integration
- **Performance**: Virtual scrolling for large task lists
- **Caching**: Redis for API response caching
- **Authentication**: User accounts and task ownership
- **Database**: Indexing and query optimization

### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power user features
- **Bulk Operations**: Select and manage multiple tasks
- **Advanced Filters**: Date ranges, custom queries
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and analytics dashboard
